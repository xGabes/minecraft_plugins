# This are some of my unfinished Minecraft Plugins.

This plugins aims to make a different type of Creative experience for players, by creating a new world for them to build in, rather than them claiming a plot. This plugin was never finished or released and there is a bug regarding the /world reset command, which I haven't gotten around to fixing.

- EquinoxCore
This plugins was meant to be the core plugin that would handle all data for the network.

- EquinoxTyphoon 
This plugins is a small minigame in which users select different classes and fight in a map using different abilities and so.
